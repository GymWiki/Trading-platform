// Freqtrade's `backtesting` command (how FreqAI training actually runs —
// see lib/hetzner.ts buildFreqAITrainingCloudInit) has no fine-grained
// progress API of its own to poll or parse from stdout robustly, so this
// endpoint blends two real signals instead of inventing a fake one:
//  1. Which stage the VM's script last actually reported reaching (see
//     POST /api/train/cloud/progress) — a genuine checkpoint, not a guess.
//  2. How long this bot's own past completed runs took — used to turn
//     "we're in the TRAINING stage" into a smooth, continuously-advancing
//     percentage and an ETA, by interpolating time spent in the current
//     stage against that stage's expected share of the average run.
// Falls back to a fixed default duration when there's no history yet
// (this bot's first-ever run) — still time-based, just without a
// personalized baseline yet. Was 20 minutes — badly stale since
// DOWNLOADING_DATA alone can now legitimately take up to
// DOWNLOAD_DATA_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES (120 min by default, see
// lib/hetzner.ts) for an auto-select bot's full-wildcard download. Raised
// to a rougher, still-approximate 45 minutes so the very first run's ETA

// DOWNLOAD_DATA_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES there (120 min default), since this
// one stage alone can now legitimately run for up to two hours for an
// auto-select bot's full-wildcard download. Without this override, the
